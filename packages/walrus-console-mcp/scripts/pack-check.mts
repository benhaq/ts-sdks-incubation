 * an unscoped package name that resolved to nothing, so every generated agent
 * config pointed at a spec that could not launch. A package that installs
 * cleanly and cannot run looks healthy from every angle except the only one
 * that matters.
 *
 * Uses `npm pack --dry-run --json`, which reports the exact file list npm would
 * publish without writing a tarball or shelling out to `tar`. Paths come back
 * unprefixed (`LICENSE`, `dist/console-mcp.js`) — there is no `package/`
 * prefix to strip.
 *
 * Requires `pnpm build` to have run first, so it is the last step in CI.
